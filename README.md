# 📝 Article & PDF Summarization Tool

This project is a simple yet powerful web application built using **Streamlit** that provides two core features:

1. **Article Research Tool** – Analyze and summarize content from URLs.
2. **PDF Summarization Tool** – Upload a PDF, extract its text, and generate concise summaries.

The app leverages cutting-edge **NLP models** from Hugging Face, uses **FAISS** for vector search, and **BERT** for extractive summarization.

##  Features

- **Article Research Tool**:
  - Input up to 3 URLs.
  - Extracts article content.
  - Summarizes or answers questions using pre-trained language models.

- **PDF Summarization Tool**:
  - Upload any PDF file.
  - Extracts the text and summarizes it with ease.

##  Setup Instructions

**1. Clone the repo & install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nisha25052005/Article-and-pdf-Summarization-tool.git
cd Article-and-pdf-Summarization-tool

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

**2. Download SpaCy Model:**

## Run the App

```bash
streamlit run workingcombine.py
```

## How to Use

* From the sidebar:

  * Choose between **Article Research Tool** or **PDF Summarization Tool**.
* For Article Research:

  * Paste 1–3 article URLs.
  * Click **"Process URLs"**.
  * Ask a question or type "summarize" to get an overview.
* For PDF Summarization:

  * Upload a PDF file.
  * Click **"Summarize"** to generate output.

## 📝 Notes

* Ensure you have a FAISS index file (e.g., `faiss_store_pretrained.pkl`) if you're loading a pretrained vector store.
* If the FAISS file doesn't exist, the app will auto-create one after processing articles.
* You can tweak the summarization model (e.g., switch from `facebook/bart-large-cnn` to any Hugging Face model).
